We wrapped up component reliability on Tuesday and start system reliability on Friday, using Fault Trees to conceptualize a system reliability problem. Materials will be provided in the workshop; there is no Git repository for this assignment, and it does not need to be turned in.

Feedback on WS05 is delayed, but will be released as soon as possible---ask Robert in class if you have questions about using component reliability in your other assignments/projects!
