This week we continue with Systems Reliability, but will pick up a few extra tips for Component Reliability as well, based on the results of WS05. The in-class session for week 7 and 8 are dedicated to working on Workshop 08. There is no WS07.

You should review WS06 if you missed class last Friday, as it introduced an essential method for quantifying and conceptualizing system reliability.

Feedback on WS05 is [posted to GitHub](https://github.com/CIE42X0-PD-24/WS05){:target="_blank"}, can be [viewed in the workbook](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/2024/workshop/05.html){:target="_blank"} and the `feedback.md` is in your group repoository.
