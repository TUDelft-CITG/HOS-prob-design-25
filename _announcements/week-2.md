Hope you have enjoyed the session on Extreme Value Analysis today and you are looking forward to applying it in the workshop next Friday!

You can find now the **slides** of the session [here](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-25/assets/lecture_slides/02_lecture_2025.pdf)

Remember that the **homework** of this week is to prepare a function for a method to support the selection of the threshold and declustering time. You have all the information about those methods in the [workbook](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-workbook/2025/EVA/threshold.html). You also have additional videos on the topic of EVA [here](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-workbook/2025/EVA/overview.html).
