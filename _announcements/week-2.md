Materials for all of week 2 are now posted (see [Week 2 overview page](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-24/week/02)).

This is the first week where you will submit the workshop assignment for a grade, so be sure to read the updated instructions on this website (see the [Assignments section of the Info page](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-24/info/#assignments)). You will also need a GitHub account to receive and submit files for the assignment.

You are free to choose your groups for WS02, and don't need to have the same groups for the next two submitted assignments (WS05 and WS08).

Finally, the solution from the Week 1 workshop has been posted in the Workbook [here](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/2024/workshop/01_solution.html#){:target="_blank"}.
