Today we have the first workshop of Probabilistic Design: Save the dike!

You can decide to perform the assignments of the course individually or in teams up to 4 members. Please, note that you need to keep the same team/doing it individually for all the assignments. After the session, please, send Patricia Mares Nasarre an email with the name of the team and the team members (name of each group member, GitHub username of each group member and email of each group member).

In order to have access to the materials of this assignment, you will need to have a GitHub account. We will distribute the assignment via GitHub Classroom. The link to the assignment is [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/mz70nXaj).

Note for people who wants to perform the assignment in teams: let a first member of the team join the classroom and create a team. Afterwards, that member of the team can share the link to the team so the rest of the members can join.

This assignment does not need to be submitted as it is not graded. The solutions will be published in the workbook and announced here.

Have fun!
