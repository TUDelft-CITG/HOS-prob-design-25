The lecture on May 6 did not have slides and was not recorded. It introduced the concept of component reliability by reviewing Monte Carlo Simulation, identifying 5 key parts of a component reliability analysis, then using a graphical interpretation for introducing the FORM Method. The concepts are summarized in the workbook [here](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-workbook/2025/component/overview.html). OpenTURNS is also introduced in the workbook. The next lecture on May 20 will further delve into the interpretation of component reliability analysis.

A special challenge was also presented: anyone who is able to successfully set up and solve the reliability problem from Workshop 1 in week 1 using OpenTURNS will get a prize if the solution in a notebook is shared with Robert by the beginning of the Friday workshop. The two key things that are required are to set up the limit state function and to use OpenTURNS to evaluate component reliability.

Remember also that in the previous announcement an update was given for lectures and workshops in the coming weeks, which you can find [here](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-25/assets/lecture_slides/Program.pdf).
