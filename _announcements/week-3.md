There are no in-class sessions this week! However, there is definitely work to be done. Specifically:
- Check out the new [Software page](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-24/software/) of the website and try setting up VS Code and a Python virtual environment.
- Do [Workshop 03](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/2024/workshop/03.html){:target="_blank"}. Note that it is a notebook, and as long as you can successfully run the cells, you will be prepared for Week 4.

Grading of WS02 (EVA) is in progress and will be returned to you via your GitHub repository when completed.
