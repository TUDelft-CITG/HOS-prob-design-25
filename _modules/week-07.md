title: "Week 7: System Reliability, Part 2"
---

Lecture
: This week we continue with Systems Reliability, but will pick up a few extra tips for Component Reliability as well, based on the results of WS05. Otherwise, view the [Collegerama recording](.){:target="_blank"} (all recordings listed [here](https://collegeramavideoportal.tudelft.nl/catalogue/ciem4220/){:target="_blank"}).

Workshop
: The in-class session for week 7 and 8 are dedicated to working on Workshop 08. There is no WS07. Workshop 08 can be started at any point and must be turned in before 4AM on Friday, June 14; the [instructions are available in the workbook](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/system/2024/workshop/08.html){:target="_blank"}; there is no Git repository for this workshop. You are also free to use the in-class sessions to ask about other probabilistic design aspects of your design projects.

<!-- Holidays
: None -->

The main goals for this week are:<br>
<i>1. Practice system reliability methods by applying a fault tree to your design project.</i><br>
<i>2. Learn a few extra tips about probabilistic design and component reliability analysis.</i><br>
{: .learningobjectives }

Review the [parallel and series system reliability approaches in the Risk and Reliability Book](https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/risk-reliability/reliability-system/overview.html){:target="_blank"}. Additional material on Fault Trees is provided in the system reliability section of the [Workbook](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/intro.html){:target="_blank"}.

You should review WS06 if you missed class last Friday, as it introduced an essential method for quantifying and conceptualizing system reliability.<br>
