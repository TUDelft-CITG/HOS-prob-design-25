title: "Week 5: Component Reliability (continued)"
---

Lecture
: Recap of WS04. Interpretation of component reliability analysis. Note that there were no slides; we used the solution to WS04 (especially the [graphical interpretation](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/2024/workshop/04/analysis.html#task-7-graphical-interpretation){:target="_blank"}. To review and prepare for WS05, use the workbook material ([FORM page here](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/2024/component/form.html#)) and the [Collegerama recording](https://collegeramavideoportal.tudelft.nl/catalogue/ciem4220/presentation/815be2824bc54b3ab3b9773f3c0f25f01d?academicYear=2023-2024-ciem4220){:target="_blank"} (all recordings listed [here](https://collegeramavideoportal.tudelft.nl/catalogue/ciem4220/){:target="_blank"}).

Workshop
: WS05 will apply component reliability techniques to an existing deterministic problem (a FEM code) and report the results. **This workshop is turned in for feedback/grading** (should be possible to finish in class on Friday, but you have until Tuesday, May 28 at 4:00 AM to submit it; you can choose your own groups). You can access the assignment via GitHub classroom with this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/dT6xfm9u){:target="_blank"}.

<!-- Holidays
: None -->

The main goals for this week are:<br>
<i>1. Identify the key results of a FORM analysis and be able to interpret them.</i><br>
<i>2. Explain the differences, advantages and disadvantages between MCS and FORM.</i><br>
<i>3. Clearly report the setup, analysis and results of a component reliability analysis.</i><br>

Additional material is provided in the component reliability section of the [Workbook](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/intro.html){:target="_blank"}.

Review WS04 and be sure you understand how the OpenTURNs code sets up and executes the MCS and FORM algorithms, as we will rely on this in WS05; the solution (`Report.md` and `Analysis_solution.ipynb`) has been posted to your GitHub repositories (update your fork) and the [Workbook](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/intro.html){:target="_blank"}.<br>
