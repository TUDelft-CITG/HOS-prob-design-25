<!-- Holidays
: None -->

The main goals for this week are:<br>
<i>1. Formulate and solve a component reliability problem with equations and code.</i><br>
<i>2. Define a limit state function for a component.</i><br>
<i>3. Use OpenTURNS Python package to solve a component reliability problem</i><br>
