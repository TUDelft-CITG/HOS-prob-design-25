# Assessment

The assessment of this **unit** will be embedded on the project/exercise portfolio and individual exam of each **B module**. The following percentages will be applied:
-	Probabilistic Design: 20%, 
-	Numerical Modelling: 25%
-	Marine Renewables / Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters / Floating and Submerged Structures: 55%

The assessment for **Probabilistic Design** is tailored for each B module as follows:
-   **HOS-B1 Marine Renewables**: 
  - Embedded chapters in the project report
  - Specific questions in the multiple-choice exam
-   **HOS-B2 Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters**: 
  - Three stand-alone exercises, submitted as part of the Portfolio (see [Unit Information page](./info.md))
  - Specific questions in the oral exam
-   **HOS-B3 Floating and Submerged Structures**:
  - Embedded chapters on the floating-submerged tunnel project
  - Specific questions in the oral exam

Note that while the three exercises submitted as part of the Portfolio{: .label .label-red } are not part of the assessment (i.e., final grade) of B1 or B3, they will still be provided a numeric score and feedback by the Probabilistic Design teaching staff. In addition, they are designed to cover the analysis that is submitted as part of your report, so don't skip them!
