# Software Overview

This page has an overview of software used.

For weeks 1-2: we will use your standard "MUDE setup," which consists of Anaconda and Jupyter Lab.

## Week 3

Starting in Week 3, we add two new software tools (as well as a new package, OPENTurns, in WS03).

1. Python Virtual Environments:
- What is an environment?
- Working with Python virtual environments (`venv`)

2. VS Code (a new IDE):
- IDE = Integrated Development Environment
- Common IDE's
- VS Code

Once you get through the set up described on the [Environments](./software/environments) and [VS Code](./software/vsc) pages, the expectation for future assignments (and most of your MSc work) is as follows:
- create a working directory (ideally clone or create a git repo)
- define a requirements file
- create a `venv`
- activate it
- install packages
- start programming!

If you need to add packages, use `pip install`, but remember to keep your requirements file up to date by adding the new package.

It is also good practice to keep notes for yourself, perhaps in a README, in the repo.
